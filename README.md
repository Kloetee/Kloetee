## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my very own first game!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, GDScript and using the Godot Engine!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning programming, thankful for any useful tipps!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the idea of my game, I'll be glad to share the broader idea and listen to your thoughts.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: discord: kloetee
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no prior programming knowledge, as my main job I'm a Paramedic.
